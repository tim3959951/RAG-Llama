# RAG-LLaMA: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Llama


This repository showcases **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using a **Large Language Model (LLM)** and **Chroma** as the vector database. The system answers questions about **President Biden’s 2023 State of the Union Address (SOTU)** by retrieving relevant text chunks (can be changed to other files for different usages), then generating a final answer. The project also demonstrates **deployment** on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ChienChung/RAG-Llama3) for real-time inference.

## Overview

**Objective:**  
Develop a retrieval-augmented question answering system tailored to President Biden’s 2023 State of the Union Address by integrating a fine-tuned LLaMA model with an efficient vector database.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct Model:** A smaller, fine-tuned variant of the LLaMA family optimized for text generation.
- **Chroma Vector Database:** Stores text embeddings for rapid and relevant retrieval.
- **LangChain Integration:** Uses RetrievalQA (chain_type="stuff") to blend retrieved context with model inference.
- **Gradio Demo:** Offers a user-friendly web interface for interactive queries on Hugging Face Spaces.

## System Architecture

1. **Model Loading:**
   - The system downloads the `meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct` model from Hugging Face, applies necessary configuration patches, and initializes it on the device.

2. **Embedding & Retrieval:**
   - The complete text of the 2023 State of the Union Address is segmented into chunks, embedded, and stored in a local Chroma database. When a query is received, the system retrieves the most relevant segments via `Chroma.as_retriever()`.

3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
   - LangChain’s RetrievalQA leverages the retrieved text fragments as context for the LLaMA model, which then generates a context-aware final answer.

4. **Gradio Interface:**
   - A Gradio interface (default port 7860) is launched, allowing users to input queries and receive immediate answers.

## How to Run

### Local Setup
1. **Clone** the repo and enter the directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tim3959951/RAG-Llama.git
   cd rag-llama
   ```
2. **Install** dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run** the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   - By default, it launches a Gradio interface at http://127.0.0.1:7860.
     
### Using Docker
1. **Clone** the repo and enter the directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tim3959951/RAG-Llama.git
   cd rag-llama
   ```
2. **Build** the image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t rag-llama .
   ```
3. **Run** the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 7860:7860 rag-llama.
   ```
   - Visit http://localhost:7860 to interact with the demo.
     
### Example Questions
- “What were the main topics regarding infrastructure in this speech?”
- “How does the speech address the competition with China?”
- “What does Biden say about Social Security or Medicare?”

## Future Improvements

- **Scaling:** Experiment with larger LLaMA models or explore QLoRA fine-tuning to enhance performance.
- **Online RAG:** Integrate real-time web scraping or additional knowledge bases to dynamically update the context.
- **UI Enhancements:** Improve the Gradio interface with richer features such as usage metrics and advanced query handling.
